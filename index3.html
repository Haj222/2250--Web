            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
              My name is Hajarah Amjad. I am a student at Cal Poly Pomona. Aside from being a student, I enjoy
              trying to utilize my spare time in a fun way. When I am not doing HW, I enjoy spending time with my my friends and family. 
              I also enjoy volunteering at my local community centers as well as my sister's school. Additionally, I enjoy flying my DJI drone 
              alongside creating weekly montages of my life. I hope to look back on these montages one day and cherish all the wonderful moments
              I had with the amazing individulas I am surrounded by.
